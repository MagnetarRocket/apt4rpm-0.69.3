- Bug fixes

- Calculate the md5sum while building the cache.  Re-use this md5sum when
  the apt meta database is build (a recent apt version is needed, supporting
  the --cachedir argument)

- Cache the modification time of the rpms.  This will make it possible to
  determine that an rpm has been modified (in case the rpm version and release
  have not changed) and as such need to be reprocessed.

- Use hard links when possible instead of soft links.  To minimize the
  number of directory look ups, when the server is in service.

- better client side support
  - special treatment for services (/etc/init.d/*), kernel, lilo
  - notification via email

- Consider to re-write aptate in Perl.

- Consider to render aptate.pl into Perl module.

- Consider to split aptate.pl into 2 Perl modules (One for config and dist).

- Add a method to tell that an rpm is an security rpm, this could just
  be a file listing the rpms.  More sophisticated would be by using
  xml for it.

- Display status change: e.g. list all new packages that were added while
  doing the last mirror.  This information could then be published on a web
  page, so apt clients can determine what are the most recent updated rpms

- Provide an option to make a physical repository (by copying the rpms e.g.)
  instead of linking the rpms into the apt repository.  This is needed in
  case the user has no shell access to the server.

- Alter the contents of the examples/sources.list.* files.
  Make the *prpm* component a seperate line.  Provide information that it is
  an autogenerated file => not all components maybe usefull or safe...

- Add support to create red-carpet info files (red-carpet uses the apt
  meta databases, but it needs a bit more information to present information
  about channels (read apt components).


Mirror functionality
---------------------
- Remove it from aptate, but if not removed the following could be done:

- a progress marker while mirroring ftp sites (with wget)

- add a -s or -S (simulate) argument option ala apt-get

- provide support for more wget arguments like:
  - proxy=on/off
  - passive-ftp
  - reject/accept certain files

- Adding some code to get the additional packages from locations other
  than ftp.suse.com/ftp.gwdg.de (see patches directory -> NVIDIA*)

- Support http connections
