	as depencies for suse

2004-11-12 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: trap - signal_spec (trap signal_spec is

2004-10-25 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: add code to check that the perl XML modules
	are working correctly
	* config/ref.conf: added. Needed for the perl XML modules check.

	prevent aptate from screwing up on eval'ing "CONFIG".
	* lib/Aptate/Repo.pm (Repo): pushd into repodir instead of using

	whitespaces.
	* server/aptate.in (full_path): Correctly quote whitespaces.
	* server/aptate.in: Double-quote.
	* server/aptate.in: Change "-c|--config-file" argument processing.

	* server/aptate.in (cache_adm): Eliminate TMP.

2004-10-05 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: change newdcomplist into newcomplist

2004-09-30 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: Eliminate broken usage of grep -w.
	(echo "fedora-2.91" | grep -w "fedora" matches. This prevented using component
	name whose names are contained in others).
	* server/aptate.in: Further POSIX-ation (Eliminate test ==, change
	[ ] into [[ ]], use || and && instead of -o and -a).
	* server/aptate.in: Cosmetics.

2004-09-29 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in (build_cache): added support for the new upcoming
	delta rpms (drpm).  On the fly the function has been simplified,
	adding a new package type, should now only be a matter of adding a
	few lines.

	* server/compare_rpm_version.in: added support for delta rpms.

2004-09-29 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in (make_links): Don't copy existing [S]RPMS.$COMP in
	case they did not change.

2004-09-27 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in (add_component): Allow empty components.
	(The previous implementation broke src-only repositories and
	forces clients to edit their sources.list for repositories with
	frequently changing contents).

2004-09-27 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: Add option "-c" for greater uniformity with
	"apt-get".
	Parse option string passed to -q and -v.

2004-09-27 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	unchanged components.
	* server/aptate.in (main): Use separate loops for UNCHANGED and
	CHANGED_COMPONENTS when creating TMP_HASHFILE.
	* server/aptate.in (main): Remove repo/-repositories (Obsolete;
	Repo.pm creates yum/repdata).

	* server/aptate.in (main): Conditionally copy changed components only.

2004-09-26 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib/Aptate/Config.pm: Revert Richard's mydie hack.
	* server/aptate.in: Eliminate backtick quotes.
	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.59, automake-1.9, ship bzip'ed
	tarballs only.

2004-09-25 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: bumped version to 0.69.0

2004-09-24 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib/Aptate/Config.pm: removed $0 from warnings and error msg as this
	   is no longer valid, now Config.pm has been converted into a perl
	   library file.  Changed the function 'die' to 'mydie'.  The latter
	   has an exit value of 3, while 'die' exist with 2.  The exit value
	   is checked in aptate, to report a perl configuration problem
	   (that is perl or a perl module is missing).  Perl's exit value is
	   than 2.  This "conflicts' with the exit value of 'die'.  Unfortenaly
	   aptate must check for system - and application errors

2004-09-21 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: report that aptate is locked to stream &3
	   instead of &4.  It will than be visible when aptate is run
	   from a cronjob.

2004-09-19 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: changed the way locking was performed.  As Ralf
	   checked in code to ensure that the final storage location is
	   always unique, it was now possible to simplify the locking
	   mechanism.  At the same time the locking is not for the whole
	   distributor, but it is now for a single distribution version.
	  The temp repository directory is now prefixed with a dot and
	   made unaccesible for visitors (700).

2004-08-24 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Tagged release 0.68.3

2004-08-23 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

2004-08-21 Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@users.sourceforge.net>

	client/rpm-sigchecker having been removed.  Those are now
	part of the default apt (client).
	Add lib/Aptate/Repo.pm to EXTRA_DIST.

2004-08-20 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* client/apt, client/aptrpm-1, client/rpm-sigchecker: Remove.

2004-06-18 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: aptate --test now uses the regular code to
	install the apt components.  The repository is installed in the
	ARCHIVE prefixed with test_.

2004-06-17 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: remove the component directories and the root
	directory.  This makes it possible that interleaved archives
	(like: suse/9.0-i386 and suse/9.0-i386/nl can exist in 1 
	repository.  Before the archive suse/9.0-i386/nl was removed, when
	the suse/9.0-i386 was installed.  On the fly the re-use of
	variables has been very improved.
	The only thing not worked on, is when the option --test is specified
	on the command line.

2004-06-12 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* lib/Aptate/Config.pm: exit with exit value 3, so aptate can
	deal with it correctly.

	  Aptate now reports how many rpms are being added and removed to the
	   cache, instead of displaying the total number
	  The variable OPT_TESTPHASE has been renamed to OPT_TEST
	  Since this version test versions are rejected for repository with a

	   position.
	  Added exit error codes

2002-12-28 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* server/aptate.in: moved code to determine if an apt component
	   actually holds rpms and that was written twice to a new

	   Uninitialized variable errors in case src rpms are processed
	* server/aptate.in: consolidated many "randomly" used variables that
	   were used to construct directories and such into variables.
	  Splitted the apt_exit function and stored some of the code into the
	   function clean_up.
	  Changed the variable D_V_A into the more independent and descriptive
	   variable ARCHIVE.

	* Release Version 0.20.
	* Bad rpms are now marked as bad rpms

	stream (3) into 2 stream (being 3 and 4).  Output stream 4 contains now
	the ANSI chars and output stream 3 provides clean status information
	* Added a cache consistency check.  The check will remove
        cache entries that contain not existing directories.

	finish successfully.

2002-05-17 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Do not change the apt component information in in rpm repository has
	not changed. This has advantages for the server as well as the client.
	Especially the client will be happy as it prevents unnecessary
	downloads.  The latter is appreciated by the server (bandwidth savings)
	as well of course. The apt server will need to do less processing
        as well :))  As the apt repository component information will be kept
	and regenerated.

2002-05-16 Richard Bos <rbos@users.sourceforge.net>

 	* Beautified the output during the mirror and link action.

	* Separated download and linking action.  First all downloading is
	done, and after that the linking is performed.
