<p>The information provided by this element is used to create an
 example /etc/apt/sources.list file for the file protocol.  The information
 is the url that describes how your apt repository users can reach your
 repository via the file protocol.  An example of such a url is:
 <i>/dist/okna98/apt</i> (it's no problem if the protocol is included in the
