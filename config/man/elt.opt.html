   <td valign=top>bad-rpm-mode</td>
   <td>The action to be performed on a bad rpm.  A bad rpm is an rpm that
    fails the command "rpm -q".  There are 2 treatments; report-only 
    and rename.
    <ul>
     <li>in <b>report-only</b> mode aptate, as it says, will inform you only.
      So manual action is required, to get the problem resolved to prevent
      the warning being reported over and over again.
     </li>
     <li>in <b>rename</b> mode aptate will move the bad rpm away.  This
      prevents that the problem is reported over and over again.  However,
      if the problem persist, because the rpm is rsync-ed over and over again
      it may be that the rpm provided by your rpm source is corrupt.  The only
      way to solve this problem is at the source: contact the rpm provider.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In both cases the rpm will be excluded from the apt repository.

  <tr>
   <td valign=top>flat</td>
   <td>The location of source rpm components.  In a flat repository (flat=yes)
    the source rpms are located at the same level as the binary rpms.  In non
    flat (flat=no) repositories the source rpms are stored 1 directory higher
    than the binary rpms.
    <br><br>
    Aptate has been optimized for flat repositories.  Aptate has no problems
    creating a non flat apt repository that holds only 1 archive.  The result
    in case the non flat repository holds more than 1 archive depends on the
    way the source rpms are organized in the rpm (not apt) repository.
    The result may be good may be bad.
    <br><br>
    Anyway, a flat repository seems the right choice for most rpm based
    distributions.

   <td valign=top>follow</td>
   <td>Follow symlinks when searching rpms in the rpm repository.  This is a
    dangerous option as the links can lead outside the apt or rpm repository.
    The apt repository maintainer must ensure this will not happen and must
    ensure that no endless loops exist in the rpm repository if directories or
    files are symlinked.

   <td valign=top>patch-rpm-component</td>
   <td>If yes, aptate will look for patch rpms and if found will make a
    seperate apt component holding patch rpms only, next to the component
    being processed.  Doing so gives the possibility to assign patch
    rpms a higher priority than regular binary rpms or to exclude them.  The
    component gets the name of the component being processed suffixed with
    a "patch-rpm-string".  The latter is explained as a seperate item.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td valign=top>patch-rpm-string</td>
   <td>The suffix that will be added to the component name in case
    the component provides patch rpms.  It is a matter of taste:
    <i>patchrpms</i> says more than <i>prpm</i>, but hopefully prpms will be
    as common as srpms...  So, the component for patch rpms will be either
    called RPMS.&lt;component name>-prpm, or RPMS.&lt;component name>-patchrpm.

  <tr>
   <td valign=top>security-component</td>
   <td>If yes, aptate makes an apt repository component providing rpms
    that have been released to solve security problems only.
    There are many reasons why it's good to have an apt component providing
    only security related rpms.  This can be because the user is behind a
    slow connection, wants to maintain to stable system, etc.
    <br>
    This functionality works now only for SuSE, however it is possible to
    extend aptate's functionality to get other distributions supported.
