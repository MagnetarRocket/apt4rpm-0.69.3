   <td>This is a wget option.
    The <a href=man:wget target=_blank>wget manual</a> states:<br>
    continue getting a partially-downloaded file.  This is useful when you
    want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of wget, or by
    another program.  More about the wget continue option in the wget manual.

  <tr>
   <td valign=top>cutdirs</td>
   <td>This is a wget option.
    The <a href=man:wget target=_blank>wget manual</a> states:<br>
    Ignore number directory components.  This is useful for getting a
    fine-grained control over the directory where recursive retrieval will be
    saved.  More about the wget cut-dirs option in the wget manual.<br>
    <br>
    The rpms being downloaded are stored under the
    &lt;sharedir>/&lt;dist-id>/update/ plus the directory obtained
    from the cutdirs action.<br>
    <br>
    Important to note; in case this option is used (cutdirs > 0) the wget
    option -no-host-directories is used by aptate too.
