	- Support directory with spaces
	- POSIX fixes
	- Prevent rpm warning message about 'incompatible rpm headers'
	- Added an exit value that telling 1 of more distid's were locked
	- Many code improvements

Version 0.69.0 - 2004-10-04
	- The component and base directories are now renewed instead of
	  the higher level (apt archive) directory.  This makes it possible
	  that interleaved archives (like: dist/4.3-i386 and win/4.3-i386/nl
	  can co-exist in 1 repository.  Before the archive win/4.3-i386/nl was
	  removed, when the win/4.3-i386 is installed.
	- Yum repositories are now installed in ARCHIVE_ROOT
	- Added support to create metadata package repositories.
	  Depends on createrepo: http://linux.duke.edu/metadata/
	- The locking mechanism has been changed, it is now possible to run
	  multiple aptate instance for 1 distributor.
        - Bug fixes
	- Performance improvements

Version 0.68.2 - 2004-05-20
	- Added YUM support
	- Change default for <opt security-component> to "no"
	- Fixed a bug if the rpm --requires output does not end with a
	  carriage return
	- Pass KEY_NAME to add_sourceslist_examples if using signed
	  repositories.
	- Generate default sources.list.FILE only if no <sources-list-*> tag
	  is given.

Version 0.67.0 - 2004-01-20
	- Added 2 configuration options;
 	  distribution::process activates or de-activates the processing of
	  archive.  This may be usefull for archives that e.g. have no update
	  activaty or in case the vendor discontinued the distribution.
	  When processing is de-activated (process="no") the actual apt archive
	  remains to exist, but it will not be updated.
	  component::scan activates or de-activates scanning of the rpm
	  directory. This is usefull for rpm directories that won't change
	  anymore, are stored on removable media, such as cd, dvd,
	  usb sticks, etc. 

Version 0.66.0 - 2003-12-30
	- A grep construction has been altered to work around a bug in grep.
	- An additional directory tag to further customize the repository 
	  directory has been added to the configuration file (aptate dtd).
	  The directory can be specified with tag <repdir>.
	- Perl script aptate-config has been converted into a perl module
 	  Aptate::Config.
	- Documentation converted from sgml to xml docbook 4.  The documentation
	  is now processed with xmlto.

	  file was located in the current working directory

Version 0.65.1 - 2003-08-18
	- The contents list (contlist) was incorrectly created, this release
	  fixes it.

Version 0.65 - 2003-08-12
	- The backup repository "*.old" is not created anymore.  A disk space
	  available check is performed before the old repository is replaced
	  with the newly created one.
	- The number of MD5 failures encountered in a cache are now reported
	  in "apt repository creation stage".
	- changed LANG=en_US to the portable LANG=C.
	- the date string in the example source.list files is now reported
	  in English. 
	- The script compare_rpm_version has been optimized, the output format
	  has changed and an --allarchs command line option has been added.
	- The format of the most recent packages list (mrlist*) have changes,
	  the rpm name, version, release, architecture and package size are now
	  seperate fields.
	- The component name is now included in the progress message that
	  reports corrupted or md5 failed rpms.  Those message can now be
	  easily grepped for as they both contain the pattern ">>".

	- Bad packages are now displayed at exit.
	- RPMs are now correctly analysed if used in a non en_US environment.
	- RPMs with an incorrect md5 sum, or packages that are just corrupt
	  are now handled the same.

Version 0.64.3 - 2003-04-12
	- Fixed a progress message redirected to an incorrect output stream
	- Removed cache conversion code
	- Improved the most recent list algorithm.  RPMs starting with a
	  string in their version of release id were not recognized
	- Updated bootstrap to work with the latest version of automake
	- Improved the find mechanism in case rpms are searched for with
	  find and the '-follow' argument is activated.  The '-follow'
	  argument is now accompanied with the argument -xtype f.  This will
	  include files only (links are skipped).
	- In quiet mode "done" is now printed during the apt database
	  creating stage, if the generation of the database has finished.

Version 0.64.2 - 2003-03-16
	- Corrected some spelling error in error messages
	- Argument "quiet" is now working again
	- The temp directory is now created more secure, using mktemp

	  repository to CD.  This resulted in a major reshuffling of the code.
	- Improved locking mechanism.
	- Changed output.
	- Some bugs have been fixed/code cleanup
	- Due to the CD functionality preparation there is an undocumented
	  argumented --action available.  It can take 2 values; server (default)
	  and mirror.

Version 0.64 - 2003-01-21
	This is major feature enhancement release.
	- The archive naming scheme is not strict anymore.  There are 3
	  predefined schemes present and the 4th one allows any naming scheme
	  the user desires.
	- Fixed a bug in the example/sources.list.FILE.
	- Minor layout updates to error/progress messages.
	- Fixed an incorrect error message in case the apt repository is 
	  writable, but the topdir is not.
	- An audit has been added to detect 0 byte *bz2 database files
	  (the root cause of this behaviour is not known).
	- Documentation update.

Version 0.63.2 - 2003-01-03
	This is a maintenance release.
	- The last remaining hard coded archive path (../../../..) has been
	  replaced by a variable.
	- The possibility to create a test repository for a non flat apt
	  repository had been removed.  It is not possible to support this
	  repository type 100% reliable.
	- The number of added and removed rpms is reported instead of the
	  total number.
	- Updated/added progress markers.
	- Moved code that was written multiple times into a function.

Version 0.63.1 - 2002-12-30
	This is a maintenance release.
	- Updated the exit (error) code.
	- Consolidated the exit error code values, they are now determined
	  by variables, making the exit values more consistent.  The exit
	  values have actually changed, compared to the previous versions.
	- Removed unused code.
	- Added better debug output.
	- Variables are checked more strictly (the characters *, / and & are
	  not allowed anylonger).
	- Moved code that was written multiple times into a function.

	
Version 0.63 - 2002-12-21
	This is a maintenance release.
	- Replaced freely used directories names into variables, making the
	  code better understandable and ready for future enhancements.
	- Removed cache conversion code.
	- Improved the lock mechanism.
	- Improved crash handling.
	- Fixed srpm linkage if the repository structure changes from
	  flat to noflat or vice versa.
	- It's now required to use the new argument --force to alter the
	  repository structure.


Version 0.62 - 2002-12-15
	We kept our promise and made sure that the warning issued with the
	previous release wasn't there for nothing.  With this release of
	aptate, almost anything that is visible from the outside of aptate
	has been changed.  The changes have been made to obtain full XML
	support in the configuration file.  Which has enabled us to combine
	the seperate config - and mirror files into 1 configuration file.
	The only thing that did not change is the structure of the apt
	repository, and that is what it is all about.

	A summary of the changes is listed below:
	- The config files have been integrated into 1 file.
	- The new config file is defined by a dtd.  This enforces that
	  the configuration is correct XML.  Which allows for checking the
	  correctness of the file.
	- Distributions are now recognized by a distribution id, instead of the
	  name/version/arch combination.
	- Many, if not all, tags in the configuration file have been renamed or
	  have moved.  Some of the elements have been converted into an
	  attribute.  A script (aptate-convert) is available to convert the
	  existing config - and mirrorfiles to the new format.  Most of the
	  conversion will be performed by the script, but your manual
	  intervention is still required.  For example to provide a
	  distribution id('s) (which is new with this release).
	- Removed many command line arguments.  The functionality is still
	  there but it can now only be configured via the configuration file.
	- Support for apt-0.5.4 has been added, aptate now supports apt-0.3.19
	  and apt-0.5.4
	- Improved the cache code made it more robust.
	- The cache creation has been speed up, by combining multiple rpm
	  queries.
	- The cache holds its information more fine grained.  As a side effect
	  it's now very easy to search for information about a certain
	  package.
	- The fine grained cache structure enabled the creation of an apt
	  repository contents file (contlist.bz2).  And it is now possible to
	  obtain a list with the most recent rpm (mrlist.<component>.bz2) for
	  an apt component (which may come in handy for automated install
	  applications like kickstart, autoyast, etc).
	- Aptate now really deals with patch rpms (prpm), they are provided
	  in their own apt component.
	- Bad rpms can now be ignored or renamed.
	- Aptate learned the difference between nosrc.rpms and src.rpms.
	- By default aptate processes all known repositories (distribution id's).
	- A command line option has been added to rebuild a cache(s).
	- A command line option has been added to rebuild apt component links.
	- The cache -, log and update directory have been moved to another
	  location:
	  update: <topdir>/apt/share/<distid>/update
	  cache:  <topdir>/apt/share/<distid>/cache
	  log:    <topdir>/apt/share/<distid>/log
	- Aptate can be configured to run external download scripts.
	- Accept and reject rpms rules based on rpm name (including path) have
	  been introduced.
	- Code has been updated to work correctly with perl-5.8
	- Added a manual describing the configuration file variables.
	- Added apt client example scripts.
	- integrated the functionality of the script genbasedir into aptate.
	- Fixed the determination of the md5/gpg rpm characteristics
	- Code cleanup.

Version 0.50 - 2002-06-12
	A lot has changed since the previous 0.20 version.  Under the hood
	apt4rpm obtained autoconf/configure support from Ralf Corsepius.
	Aptate is more robust and has been given its own man page too :)

	Very visible is the new and default "flat" repository mode.
	This means that the source rpms (SRPMS) are being stored at the same
	level as the binary rpms.  The big advantage is that source rpms of
	different distribution versions are not mixed any longer.  The first
	time you run the new aptate version, a message will be reported that the
	existing apt repository is being changed from "noflat" to "flat".  This
	is okay, there won't we such messages for the subsequent aptate runs.
	
	All changes are being listed below.

	WARNING:
	For the next version of aptate we expect a big incompatible change in 
	the layout of the configuration files.  We hope that the 2 or more 
	config files that aptate now requires will be integrated into 1 big 
	unified xml formatted config file.
	So don't tell us with the next release, that you did not expect the
	API to be changed!
	
	* server/aptate:
	  - Add flat repository support.
	  - Added support for switching from flat to noflat apt repositories
            and vice versa
            NOTE: the flat repository is now the default APT repository.
	    This used to be "noflat"
	  - The release.* files are now always refreshed and reflect when
	    aptate has run (or when the apt repository has been created)
	  - Remove -H, --Help. let --help print long help to stdout.
	  - Fixed problem with signed repositories
	  - Corrected a bug, if an rpm disappeared from the rpm repository an
	    error was reported by "mv"
	  - Added progress markers
	  - Improved the cache audit
	  - Code cleanup.
	* Autoconf/automake support, adaptation to GNU standards.
	* New apt4rpm.spec it is now dependend on perl-XML-Simple
	* server/aptate.pl: Several minor cleanups.
	* New config/aptate.conf.dtd, config/mirrorlist.dtd.
	* Rename config/aptate.conf to config/aptate.conf.xml.
	* Remove misc/apt-cvs.spec and misc/apt4rpm.spec (Obsolete).
	* Reworked changelog and renamed to NEWS.
	* Add manpage for aptate (aptate.8).

Version 0.20 - 2002-05-19
	* Bad rpms are now marked as bad rpms
	* Introduced an additional output stream, dividing the
          progress marker's stream (3) into 2 stream (being 3
          and 4).  Output stream 4 contains now the ANSI chars and
          output stream 3 provides clean status information
	* Added a cache consistency check.  The check will remove
          cache entries that contain not existing directories
	* Make the "old" left behind (test) APT repository 
          unreadable for group and others
	* Exit aptate and provide an error report, in case
          genbasedir does not finish succesfully
	* Do not change the apt component information in
          in rpm repository has not changed.  This has
          advantages for the server as well as the client.
          Especially the client will be happy as it prevents
          unnecessary downloads.  The latter is appreciated by
          the server (bandwidth savings) as well of course.
          The apt server will need to do less processing 
          as well :))  As the apt repository component information
          will be kept and regenerated.
	* Beautified the output during the mirror and link action

Version 0.1.4 - 2002-05-09
	* fix a problem introduced by SuSE, as SuSE is now releasing patch rpms.
	  These have different dependencies compared to the "real" rpms.
	* Separated download and linking action.  First all downloading is 
	  done, and after that the linking is performed.

Version 0.1.3 - 2002-04-23
	* fix a problem when only 1 dir is being specified as exclude
	  directory.

Version 0.1.2 - 2002-04-20 
	* Removed references to aptatemod in error messages as aptatemod is in
	  a bad shape.
	* Fix incorrect aptate.pl parsing when only 1 component is configured
	  in the mirrorlistfile.
	* Fix inconsistent argument signed_pkgs_only into signed-pkgs-only.
	* Fix incorrect file and http example sources.list files.

Version 0.1.1 - 2002-03-10 
	* Fix <cutdirs>0</cutdirs> in the mirrorfile.
	* Added Nvidia example to the mirrorfile.
